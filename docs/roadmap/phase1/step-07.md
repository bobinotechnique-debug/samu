# Phase 1 - Step 07: UI Page Contracts

## Purpose
Register the completed UI page contracts that assemble approved Phase 1 components into authoritative planning surfaces and ensure they remain discoverable for implementation planning.

## Scope
- Documentation-only registration of page contracts aligned to API conventions, RBAC, audit, and ownership rules.
- Cross-linking with Step 04 conventions and Step 06 component contracts; no backend, frontend, or infrastructure changes.
- Index updates to keep page contracts discoverable and authoritative.

## Status
Done

## Deliverables
- docs/specs/16_ui_page_contracts.md - global page contract rules, navigation, shared state model, and forbidden patterns.
- docs/ux/pages/INDEX.md - catalog of page contracts.
- docs/ux/pages/01_planning.md - planning page contract using approved components.
- docs/ux/pages/02_mission.md - mission page contract using approved components.
