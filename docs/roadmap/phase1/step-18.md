# Phase 1 Step 18 - Planning Rules and Constraints Contract

## Status
Proposed

## Purpose
Capture authoritative planning rules, including hard vs soft constraints, conflict types, time overlap rules, capacity limits, and role/skill matching expectations.

## Planned Deliverables
- docs/specs/23_planning_rules_contract.md (next available number beyond existing specs catalog)
- docs/specs/INDEX.md update

## Acceptance Snapshot
- Each rule documents id, description, severity, trigger conditions, impacted entities, and remediation guidance.
- Rules align with existing ownership, RBAC, audit, and API conventions without modifying prior artifacts.
