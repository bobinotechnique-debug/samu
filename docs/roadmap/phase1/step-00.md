# Phase 1 - Step 00: Foundational Documentation Kickoff

## Objective
Initiate Phase 1 by establishing documentation baselines, rules, and indexes required to guide specification work without touching application code.

## Scope
- Define Phase 1 constraints emphasizing documentation-only output.
- Establish roadmap entries and navigation for Phase 1 steps.
- Seed specification skeletons for glossary, domain, mission model, and security/multi-tenancy references under docs/specs/.

## Deliverables
- Phase 1 roadmap index and step records registered in docs/roadmap/INDEX.md and docs/roadmap/next_steps.md.
- Phase 1 rules clarifying that backend, frontend, and infrastructure changes are out of scope.
- Baseline specification documents created under docs/specs/ with purpose, scope, assumptions, and exclusions sections.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All new documentation files are referenced in relevant indexes.
- Phase 0 marked closed with closure date and final step reference.
- Agent contracts updated to enforce Phase 1 documentation-only constraints.
- No TODOs remain without an owner and roadmap reference.

## Explicit Non-Goals
- Implementing backend, frontend, or infrastructure code changes.
- Altering CI pipelines or operational scripts beyond documentation updates.
- Introducing product features beyond documentation and specification baselines.
