# Phase 1 - Step 22: Planning Economic Extension (Amendment)

## Purpose
Document an amendment under the Phase 1 lock (Step 14) to strengthen planning-driven economic pilotage and contract coherence without implementing business logic.

## Status
Proposed (documentation-only).

## Objectives
- Provide derived, display-only planning cost views scoped to mission and project.
- Link contracts to assignments with lifecycle alignment and non-blocking completeness warnings surfaced in dashboards and project views.
- Introduce project and mission-scoped cost centers for planning-oriented financial lines without accounting ledgers or cross-project aggregation.

## Deliverables
- docs/specs/29_planning_cost_view.md
- docs/specs/30_contract_assignment_link.md
- docs/specs/31_cost_centers.md
- Index updates registering the specifications.
- CHANGELOG.md entry capturing this amendment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Organization remains the security boundary; project is the functional boundary; mission is the execution and cost aggregation unit.
- Costs are derived estimates only; no stored totals, automatic payments, banking sync, or legal exports.
- Contract completeness warnings are non-blocking and visible in dashboard and project views.

## Notes
- Follows the Step 21 amendment precedent and respects docs/roadmap/phase1/step-14.md non-regression rules.
