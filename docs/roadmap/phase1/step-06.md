# Phase 1 - Step 06: UI Component Contracts

## Purpose
Register the completed UI component contracts that translate the visual language into reusable building blocks for planning surfaces.

## Scope
- Documentation-only registration of cross-view component contracts and supporting UX component specifications.
- Alignment with API conventions, visual language tokens, RBAC, audit, and ownership rules locked in prior steps.
- Index updates to ensure component contracts are discoverable and authoritative.

## Status
Done

## Deliverables
- docs/specs/15_ui_component_contracts.md - global component rules, state model, accessibility baseline, and forbidden patterns.
- docs/ux/components/01_data_table.md - tabular mission and assignment presentation contract.
- docs/ux/components/02_timeline_bar.md - mission timeline bar and milestone contract.
- docs/ux/components/03_avatar_stack.md - grouped collaborator avatar contract.
- docs/ux/components/04_conflict_badge.md - conflict and alert badge contract.
- docs/ux/components/05_filter_bar.md - filter control contract aligned to API conventions.
