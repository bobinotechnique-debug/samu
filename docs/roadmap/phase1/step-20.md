# Phase 1 Step 20 - Permissions and Responsibility Matrix

## Status
Proposed

## Purpose
Clarify who can perform which actions across organization, project, and mission scopes with explicit deny rules and audit expectations.

## Planned Deliverables
- docs/specs/25_permissions_matrix.md (next available number beyond existing specs catalog)

## Acceptance Snapshot
- Table maps role x action x entity x scope, including default-deny cases and audit requirements.
- Aligns with Phase 1 RBAC, ownership, and audit conventions without altering existing artifacts.
