# Phase 1 - Step 05: UX Visual Language and View Specifications

## Purpose
Register the completed UX visual language and planning view specifications so they remain authoritative before implementation begins.

## Scope
- Documentation-only registration of visual language tokens and planning view contracts.
- Alignment of UX surfaces with previously locked API conventions, domain ownership, and RBAC rules.
- Cross-references to existing specifications and UX documents without altering their content.

## Status
Done

## Deliverables
- docs/specs/14_visual_language.md - semantic visual language, interaction tokens, and state treatments for planning experiences.
- docs/ux/11_planning_timeline.md - timeline view behavior, states, and API alignment.
- docs/ux/12_planning_board.md - planning board intents, state handling, and ownership cues.
- docs/ux/13_project_mission_flows.md - mission lifecycle flows mapped to RBAC, audit, and API rules.
