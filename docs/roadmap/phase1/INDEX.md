# Phase 1 Roadmap Index

## Status
Active; executing Step 04 to lock API and integration conventions.

## Steps
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-00.md - Phase 1 Step 00: initiate documentation-focused phase (Status: Done).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-02.md - Phase 1 Step 02: architecture guardrails, contracts, and failure patterns (Status: Done).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-03.md - Phase 1 Step 03: data ownership, RBAC, and audit rules (Status: Done).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-04.md - Phase 1 Step 04: API and integration conventions (Status: In progress).

## Notes
- Phase 1 prohibits backend, frontend, and infrastructure code changes; scope is limited to documentation artifacts.
- Step 02 depends on foundational domain documentation outcomes from Step 01 (glossary, domain model, project/mission model).
- Step 03 depends on Step 01 for terminology and Step 02 for architecture and contract guardrails.
- Step 04 depends on Steps 02 and 03 to align API contracts with architecture, ownership, RBAC, and audit invariants.
