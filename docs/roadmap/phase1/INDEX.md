# Phase 1 Roadmap Index

## Status
Active; executing Step 04 to lock API and integration conventions; Steps 05 and 06 completed and registered.

## Steps
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-00.md - Phase 1 Step 00: initiate documentation-focused phase (Status: Done).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-02.md - Phase 1 Step 02: architecture guardrails, contracts, and failure patterns (Status: Done).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-03.md - Phase 1 Step 03: data ownership, RBAC, and audit rules (Status: Done).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-04.md - Phase 1 Step 04: API and integration conventions (Status: In progress).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-05.md - Phase 1 Step 05: UX visual language and view specifications (Status: Done).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-06.md - Phase 1 Step 06: UI component contracts (Status: Done).

## Notes
- Phase 1 prohibits backend, frontend, and infrastructure code changes; scope is limited to documentation artifacts.
- Step 02 depends on foundational domain documentation outcomes from Step 01 (glossary, domain model, project/mission model).
- Step 03 depends on Step 01 for terminology and Step 02 for architecture and contract guardrails.
- Step 04 depends on Steps 02 and 03 to align API contracts with architecture, ownership, RBAC, and audit invariants.
- Step 05 depends on Step 04 outputs for API alignment and keeps UX surfaces consistent with visual language rules.
- Step 06 depends on Step 05 visual language decisions to keep component contracts consistent across views.
