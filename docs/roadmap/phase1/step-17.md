# Phase 1 Step 17 - Domain Object Contracts

## Status
Proposed

## Purpose
Define authoritative meanings, ownership, invariants, and lifecycle hooks for Organization, Project, Mission, Assignment, Collaborator, Availability, Role, and Skill without binding to storage or UI.

## Planned Deliverables
- docs/specs/22_domain_object_contracts.md (next available number beyond existing specs catalog)
- docs/specs/INDEX.md update

## Acceptance Snapshot
- Each object documents definition, ownership scope, required fields, invariants, lifecycle links, and audit events.
- Additive documentation only; no renumbering of prior steps or specs.
