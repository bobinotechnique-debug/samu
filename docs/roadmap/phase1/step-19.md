# Phase 1 Step 19 - State Machines and Lifecycles

## Status
Proposed

## Purpose
Define state machines for Project, Mission, Assignment, and Publication so later implementations cannot enter impossible states.

## Planned Deliverables
- docs/specs/24_state_machines.md (next available number beyond existing specs catalog)

## Acceptance Snapshot
- ASCII diagrams outline states, transitions, guard conditions, and audit events per transition.
- Additive documentation only; prior artifacts remain unchanged.
