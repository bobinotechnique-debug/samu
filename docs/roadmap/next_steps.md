# Roadmap Next Steps

## Upcoming Work
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-02.md - Execute architecture principles, domain contracts, and failure pattern documentation (Active).
- Phase 1 - Step 03 - Pending: iterate on execution alignment after guardrails are in place (to be defined in roadmap before implementation).

## Notes
- Next steps must remain within Phase 1 documentation-only scope until completion criteria authorize code work.
- Step 03 cannot start until Step 02 acceptance criteria are met and logged.
