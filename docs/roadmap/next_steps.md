# Roadmap Next Steps

## Upcoming Work
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-04.md - Execute API and integration convention documentation (Active).
- Phase 1 wrap-up - Close Step 04 and confirm all Phase 1 documentation steps (00-06) are indexed and marked Done before enabling implementation planning.

## Notes
- Next steps must remain within Phase 1 documentation-only scope until completion criteria authorize code work.
- Step 04 operates under documentation-only scope and assumes Steps 02 and 03 acceptance criteria are met and logged.
- Steps 05 and 06 are completed and registered; they gate component implementation planning once Phase 1 is closed.
