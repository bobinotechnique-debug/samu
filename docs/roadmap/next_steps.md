# Roadmap Next Steps

## Upcoming Work
- Phase 1 is LOCKED under docs/roadmap/phase1/step-14.md; no further Phase 1 edits are allowed without formal amendment specs referencing the sealed artifacts.
- Phase 1 documentation baseline is stable and serves as the authoritative reference for future phases.
- Prepare Phase 2 planning items that consume Phase 1 contracts without altering identifiers, ownership, RBAC, API, or UI rules.
- Any corrections to Phase 1 must follow the Step 14 amendment path with migration notes and explicit references.

## Notes
- Next steps must honor Phase 1 contracts without modifying the sealed documentation; any divergence requires a Step 14 amendment.
- Implementation planning for later phases must reference Phase 1 outputs and preserve ownership, RBAC, audit, identifier/time, and API conventions.
- Phase 2 Step 14 must deliver enforceable observability, structured logging, and audit hook guidance aligned to Phase 1 error, audit, and multi-tenancy contracts.
