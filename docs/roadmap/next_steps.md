# Roadmap Next Steps

## Upcoming Work
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-04.md - Execute API and integration convention documentation (Active).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-11.md - Maintain cross-domain read model and integration rule roadmap coverage (Active).
- docs/specs/18_cross_domain_read_models.md - Deliver Phase 1 Step 11 cross-domain read models (Active).
- docs/specs/19_domain_integration_rules.md - Deliver Phase 1 Step 11 integration guardrails (Active).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-08.md - Document roadmap and execution sheet contracts (Proposed).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-09.md - Document inventory and equipment management contracts (Proposed).
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-10.md - Document finance and accounting contracts (Proposed).
- Phase 1 wrap-up - Close Step 04 and confirm all Phase 1 documentation steps (00-10) are indexed and marked Done before enabling implementation planning.

## Notes
- Next steps must remain within Phase 1 documentation-only scope until completion criteria authorize code work.
- Step 04 operates under documentation-only scope and assumes Steps 02 and 03 acceptance criteria are met and logged.
- Steps 05, 06, and 07 are completed and registered; they gate component and page implementation planning once Phase 1 is closed.
- Steps 08-10 are documentation-only extensions and depend on Steps 02-04 for ownership, RBAC, audit, identifier/time, and API conventions.
