# Roadmap Next Steps

## Upcoming Work
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-03.md - Execute data ownership, RBAC, and audit documentation (Active).
- Phase 1 - Step 04 - Pending: extend implementation readiness steps after data and permission guardrails are locked (to be defined in roadmap before implementation).

## Notes
- Next steps must remain within Phase 1 documentation-only scope until completion criteria authorize code work.
- Step 03 operates under documentation-only scope and assumes Step 02 acceptance criteria are met and logged.
