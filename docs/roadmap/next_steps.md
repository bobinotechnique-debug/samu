# Roadmap Next Steps

## Upcoming Work
- docs/roadmap/phase1/step-04.md - Execute API and integration convention documentation (Active).
- Phase 1 - Step 05 - Pending: prepare implementation kickoff once API conventions and error models are locked (to be defined in roadmap before implementation).

## Notes
- Next steps must remain within Phase 1 documentation-only scope until completion criteria authorize code work.
- Step 04 operates under documentation-only scope and assumes Steps 02 and 03 acceptance criteria are met and logged.
