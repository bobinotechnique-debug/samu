# Phase 2 Step 04 - API Architecture and Routing

## Status
Starting

## Objective
Define API wiring and conventions in practice, including route groups, versioning, error mapping, and pagination that match Phase 1 API contracts.

## Deliverables
- docs/api/20_api_architecture.md capturing route group scaffolds, versioning approach, error mapping, and pagination rules for Phase 2.

## Dependencies
- API conventions, error model, and versioning baseline (docs/specs/10_api_conventions.md, docs/specs/11_api_error_model.md, docs/specs/12_api_versioning.md).
- Service boundaries from High Level Architecture (docs/specs/20_architecture_HLD.md).
