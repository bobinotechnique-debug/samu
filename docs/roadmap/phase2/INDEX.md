# Phase 2 Roadmap Index

## Status
Starting. Phase 2 focuses on translating Phase 1 contracts into technical architecture with service, data, and deployment skeletons.

## Steps
- docs/roadmap/phase2/step-01-high-level-architecture.md - Step 01: High Level Architecture definition and context boundaries (Status: Starting).
- docs/roadmap/phase2/step-02-low-level-architecture.md - Step 02: Low Level Architecture and layering per service (Status: Starting).
- docs/roadmap/phase2/step-03-persistence-model.md - Step 03: Persistence and data model mapping to Phase 1 entities (Status: Starting).
- docs/roadmap/phase2/step-04-api-architecture.md - Step 04: API architecture and routing conventions in practice (Status: Starting).
- docs/roadmap/phase2/step-05-async-and-jobs.md - Step 05: Async execution model and background jobs (Status: Starting).
- docs/roadmap/phase2/step-06-security-and-trust.md - Step 06: Security and trust mechanisms with org isolation (Status: Starting).
- docs/roadmap/phase2/step-07-frontend-architecture.md - Step 07: Frontend architecture scaffolding (Status: Starting).
- docs/roadmap/phase2/step-08-deployment-and-environments.md - Step 08: Deployment and environment definitions (Status: Starting).
- docs/roadmap/phase2/step-09-observability-and-operations.md - Step 09: Observability and operations baseline (Status: Starting).
- docs/roadmap/phase2/step-10-implementation-bootstrap.md - Step 10: Implementation bootstrap and runnable skeleton (Status: Starting).

## Notes
- Phase 2 must honor the Phase 1 lock (Step 14) while building additive architecture artifacts.
- Each step references Phase 1 specifications (ownership, RBAC, audit, API conventions) to guarantee continuity.
