## Status
Starting

## Objective
Define frontend technical architecture including app shell, state management, and data fetching scaffolding with no business logic in the UI, adhering to locked UX/page contracts.

## Deliverables
- docs/ux/20_frontend_architecture.md outlining frontend layering, shared utilities, API client usage, and state patterns.

## Dependencies
- UI component and page contracts (docs/specs/15_ui_component_contracts.md, docs/specs/16_ui_page_contracts.md).
- API conventions and versioning rules (docs/specs/10_api_conventions.md, docs/specs/12_api_versioning.md).
