# Phase 2 Step 02 - Low Level Architecture

## Status
Starting

## Objective
Define internal structure per service with package layout, dependency rules, and layering (API/service/domain/infra) without implementing business logic, keeping alignment with Phase 1 contracts.

## Deliverables
- docs/specs/21_architecture_LLD.md detailing per-service layers, allowed dependencies, and module boundaries.

## Dependencies
- High Level Architecture (docs/specs/20_architecture_HLD.md).
- Architecture principles and failure patterns (docs/specs/04_architecture_principles.md, docs/specs/06_known_failure_patterns.md).
