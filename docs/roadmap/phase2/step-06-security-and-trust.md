## Status
Starting

## Objective
Define concrete security mechanisms including auth flows, token scopes, and data isolation to guarantee organization-level separation and align with Phase 1 security principles.

## Deliverables
- docs/specs/24_security_model.md detailing authentication flows, token contents, enforcement hooks, and isolation guarantees.

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 security and multi-tenancy rules (docs/specs/03_multi_tenancy_and_security.md, docs/specs/07_data_ownership.md, docs/specs/08_rbac_model.md).
- Audit and error contracts (docs/specs/09_audit_and_traceability.md, docs/specs/11_api_error_model.md).
