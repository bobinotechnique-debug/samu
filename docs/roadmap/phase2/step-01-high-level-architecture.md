# Phase 2 Step 01 - High Level Architecture

## Status
Starting

## Objective
Define the global technical shape of the platform, including context boundaries, service responsibilities, synchronous versus asynchronous flows, and trust boundaries while honoring Phase 1 ownership, RBAC, and audit rules.

## Deliverables
- docs/specs/20_architecture_HLD.md capturing context diagram narratives, service boundaries, sync/async flows, and trust boundaries.

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 architecture principles and domain contracts (docs/specs/04_architecture_principles.md, docs/specs/05_domain_contracts.md).
- Ownership and security baselines (docs/specs/03_multi_tenancy_and_security.md, docs/specs/07_data_ownership.md, docs/specs/08_rbac_model.md).
