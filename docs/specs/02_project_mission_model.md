# Project and Mission Model

## Purpose
Outline how projects encapsulate missions and assignments to preserve planning coherence.

## Scope
- Project lifecycle states and how missions attach to projects.
- Assignment rules within a project boundary, including collaborator linkage.

## Assumptions
- Missions cannot exist outside a project and must inherit its organization context.
- Phase 1 captures conceptual rules only; implementations follow in later phases.

## Exclusions
- Scheduling timelines, calendars, or capacity planning mechanics.
- Frontend workflow descriptions or UI states.
