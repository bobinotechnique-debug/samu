# Glossary

## Purpose
Define consistent terminology for the multi-tenant planning SaaS to avoid ambiguity across agents and phases.

## Scope
- Core domain terms used across projects, missions, collaborators, and execution sites.
- Security and tenancy language that affects documentation and future design.

## Assumptions
- Terms align with the project-centric model defined in AGENT.md.
- Phase 1 outputs remain documentation-only and will be expanded in later steps.

## Exclusions
- Implementation-specific API payload definitions.
- UI copy or localization details.
