## Scope

- Authorization requirements for API access patterns to be defined later.

## Assumptions

- Phase 1 focuses on narrative guidance; enforcement mechanisms will be designed in later steps.

## Exclusions
- Implementation details for identity providers or authentication flows.
- Infrastructure hardening steps or secrets management tooling.
