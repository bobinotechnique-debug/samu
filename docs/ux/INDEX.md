# UX Documentation Index

This index mirrors ux/INDEX.md and consolidates UX research and flow documentation.

- Primary UX notes live in ux/INDEX.md.
- Roadmap alignment and AGENT.md precedence are mandatory before changes.
- Maintain ASCII-only content for automation compatibility.

## Catalog

- docs/ux/12_planning_board.md - planning board intents, states, and ownership cues.
- docs/ux/13_project_mission_flows.md - mission lifecycle flows aligned to RBAC and audit requirements.
