# UX Documentation Index

This index mirrors ux/INDEX.md and consolidates UX research, flow documentation, and component contracts.

- Primary UX notes live in ux/INDEX.md.
- Roadmap alignment and AGENT.md precedence are mandatory before changes.
- Maintain ASCII-only content for automation compatibility.
