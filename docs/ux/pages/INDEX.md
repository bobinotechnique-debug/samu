# Page Contracts Index

Authoritative index for Phase 1 page contracts. Step 16 reconciles the earlier Step 07 registration gap without renumbering existing artifacts. All page docs follow the shared template and assemble only approved Phase 1 components defined in docs/specs/15_ui_component_contracts.md and governed by docs/specs/16_ui_page_contracts.md.

## Catalog (Step 16 Additions)
- docs/ux/pages/01_planning_page.md - Planning page contract (reconciled numbering).
- docs/ux/pages/02_mission_page.md - Mission page contract (reconciled numbering).
- docs/ux/pages/03_collaborator_page.md - Collaborator page contract (reconciled numbering).
