# Operations Documentation Index

This index governs operational records, including guard behaviors and error logs.

- Status and inventory: docs/STATUS_SUMMARY.md.

## Files
- docs/ops/agent_errors.md - mandatory failure memory log.
- docs/ops/20_deployment_architecture.md - Phase 2 deployment and environment architecture (local, CI, staging, production).
- docs/ops/21_observability.md - Phase 2 observability baseline (logging, metrics, tracing, health checks, alerting, runbooks).

## Rules
- Log every Codex failure once using the required template.
- Keep operational guidance ASCII-only to satisfy guard expectations.
