# API Documentation Index

This index mirrors api/INDEX.md and tracks API contract records under Docs Agent governance.

- Status and inventory: docs/STATUS_SUMMARY.md.

- Refer to api/INDEX.md for endpoint catalogs and schemas.
- Align updates with roadmap steps and AGENT.md precedence.
- Ensure API docs stay ASCII-only and validated by guards.
- docs/api/20_api_architecture.md - Phase 2 API architecture and routing skeleton (route groups, versioning, error mapping, pagination).
