# Guard Framework Placeholder

This directory will host guard definitions and supporting scripts for CI and local validation.

Planned guard categories:
- Security and secret scanning
- Formatting and linting enforcement
- Dependency and supply chain validation
- Environment readiness checks

No guards are implemented during Phase 0. Future phases must populate this directory with documented guard behaviors and invocation instructions.
