# Phase 0 - Step 00: Bootstrap

## Goal
Establish the initial repository scaffolding, guardrails, and roadmap anchors for the Codex orchestrator.

## Deliverables
- Repository skeleton with documentation roots and agent contracts.
- Baseline guard requirements covering ASCII-only output and roadmap registration.
- Index references that point to roadmap and documentation seeds.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Repository contains Phase 0 roadmap entries and indexes referenced by guard scripts.
- Guard scaffolding blocks non-ASCII content and missing navigation anchors.
- Phase 0 baseline marked as sealed once validation passes.

## Status
Done

## Notes
This bootstrap step underpins later hardening (docs/roadmap/phase0/step-01-harden-bootstrap.md) and remains immutable for downstream phases.
