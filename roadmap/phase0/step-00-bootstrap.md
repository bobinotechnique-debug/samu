# Phase 0 - Step 00: Bootstrap Orchestration Skeleton

## Goal
Establish repository scaffolding and orchestration contracts required for Phase 0.

## Deliverables
- Repository tree aligned with AGENT.md section 5.
- Root documentation and changelog initialization.
- Sub-agent contract stubs for backend, frontend, devops, and docs.
- Documentation index placeholders for routing.
- Error learning log template.
- PowerShell guard scripts for ASCII, docs, roadmap, and agent precedence.
- CI workflow skeletons marked as placeholders.

## Status
Done

## Risks and Notes
- All scripts are placeholders and intentionally fail until implemented in later phases.
- Workflows are placeholders and perform no validation yet.
- Guards enforce ASCII-only output and required documentation presence; keep all contributions compliant.
