# Phase 1 - Step 21: Accounting and Contracts Extension (Amendment)

## Goal
Record the Phase 1 amendment covering accounting and contracts documentation without altering locked artifacts.

## Deliverables
- docs/specs/27_comptabilite.md capturing accounting scope, lifecycles, exports, permissions, and audit expectations.
- docs/specs/28_contrats.md defining contract types, lifecycle, templates, attachments, permissions, and audit requirements.
- docs/specs/phase1_coherence_audit_compta_contrats.md validating alignment with Phase 1 constraints.
- Index, roadmap, and changelog updates referencing this amendment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Content is ASCII-only, uniquely numbered, and indexed in docs/specs/INDEX.md and specs/INDEX.md.
- Roadmap entries reflect the amendment under the Step 14 lock with no cross-organization access or business logic.
- Audit confirms coherence with glossary, domain, RBAC, audit/traceability, and multi-tenancy contracts.

## Status
Proposed

## Notes
This step follows docs/roadmap/phase1/step-14.md (lock charter) and extends the finance/accounting scope introduced in docs/roadmap/phase1/step-10.md through documentation-only artifacts.
