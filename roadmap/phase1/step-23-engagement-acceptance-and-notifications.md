# Phase 1 - Step 23: Engagement, Acceptance, and Notifications (Amendment)

## Goal
Record the documentation-only amendment that locks the engagement ladder, enriched acceptance model, reminders/escalations, engagement timeline, execution documents, and audit journal under the Phase 1 charter.

## Deliverables
- docs/specs/32_engagement_acceptance_and_notifications.md
- docs/specs/phase1_coherence_audit_engagement_acceptance.md
- Index updates and CHANGELOG entry
- Roadmap references under docs/roadmap/phase1/step-23-engagement-acceptance-and-notifications.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- ASCII-only documentation with unique numbering and roadmap linkage
- No code, legal enforcement, payroll computation, or irreversible automation introduced
- Organization boundary enforced; project is the functional boundary; mission is the execution unit; assignments are atomic planning units
- Reminders/escalations are declarative, non-blocking, and auditable

## Status
Proposed
